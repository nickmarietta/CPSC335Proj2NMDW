# CPSC335Proj2NMDW
This is the repository for Project 2 for CPSC 335 with Professor Moryani. The contributors are Nicklaus Marietta and Dylan Wong.

## Instructions for Using the Program
Download the zip folder and then open it in VS Code or a similar IDE.

**To run the first and second problem**
```bash
python/python3 prob1.py (same thing for prob2 but just prob2.py)
```
(You can add your own test cases in the code itself by editing or adding more print statements of this form:

```python
nums = [?]
k = n
print("Example 1: nums = [?], k = n  Output:", topMostKFrequent(nums, k))
```
